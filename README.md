# MLR_vs_LR_User_Satisfaction
Predicting software user satisfaction using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Simple Linear Regression (LR) with Python. Includes exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and visual comparison of predictions.


# Predicting User Satisfaction with Linear Regression

This repository demonstrates **predictive modeling of user satisfaction scores** using both **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** and **Simple Linear Regression (LR)**. The analysis revisits traditional regression concepts and applies them with the **latest Python libraries** for practical insights in software and IT analytics.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict a product's User Satisfaction Score based on key factors.
- **Independent Variables (MLR):**
  - Average Response Time (s)
  - Number of Features
  - Number of Bugs Reported
  - Training Hours Provided
- **Independent Variable (LR):** Product Quality (for simple linear regression)
- **Dependent Variable:** User Satisfaction Score
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- **Key Insights:**
  - MLR captures multiple influencing factors and improves predictive performance.
  - Visual comparison of predicted vs actual scores highlights model accuracy.
